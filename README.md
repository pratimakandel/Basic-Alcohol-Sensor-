# Basic-Alcohol-Sensor-

This project is titled, “Car alcohol detector”. In this project, we interfaced an Alcohol Sensor using Arduino Uno. We used an MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor, also called a Breathalyzer to estimate the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) present in a person’s body. This is done by using a person’s breath to measure the amount of alcohol (chemical name: Ethanol).  The person must blow close to the sensor,  and the chemical sensor will convert the ethanol within the volume/temperature into an electrical signal, which determines the resistance that corresponds to different values of intoxication. 
We have also added other exciting features such as neopixel and lcd. Accordingly, the neopixel lights up in different colors when the sensor prints the result out in the lcd.
